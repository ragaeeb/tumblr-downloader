# Getting Started

The purpose of this project is to download a Tumblr blog's content's posts that meets certain keywords. The
reason for the inception of this project is because Tumblr's search API is poor and will not search all the
blogs for what you are looking for (most likely performance reasons). So this can be used to try to find
specific posts from specific blogs.

## Auth Token

To use it, in the `config.json` file, simply add the keywords you want to match in the blogs and
add the API key in it that can be gotten from here: https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps
